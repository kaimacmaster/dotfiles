# My NeoVim configuration

This is my personal configuration, based on LazyVim starter. It is a simple and clean configuration that I use for my daily work. I was fine working on my own configuration without a starter, but I saw quite a few things online about Lazy, and decided to give it a go, it was a good decision as it was almost my configuration, but with some extra goodies that I didn't have. I have been using it for a while now, and I am very happy with it.
